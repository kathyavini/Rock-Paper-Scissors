# About this Project
This is my first JS project! This game was made as part of The Odin Project Curriculum. 

Visit The Odin Project for [original game instructions](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) (with alert() and console.log() gameplay) and for instructions on [adding DOM manipulation/GUI](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation).
